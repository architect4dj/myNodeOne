Last year, our Distinguished Engineers provided an eclectic list of books to read for the holiday season. From competitive memorization and pandemics to amazing biographies, DEs offered a varied list of options for any reader. This year, the tradition continues with even more amazing books! Whether you are looking to relax, learn, design or explore, there is an option for you. Check out the list below - and  Happy Holidays from the JPMorgan Chase Distinguished Engineers!
Read and Relax

4321.pngcosmos.jpgWhen the holiday vacation begins, Matt Tice looks for a book that offers purely enjoyable reading. One of his recent favorites is 4321 by Paul Auster. This book shares the story of a man's life from four competing viewpoints and during four different time periods of his life. The differing viewpoints of the same time period change the relationships and the nature of those relationships, which result in very different life paths. If you want something slightly more cerebral, check out Calculating the Cosmos by Ian Stewart, which is Darren Marvin's pick. In this book, the author presents an exhilarating guide to the cosmos, from our solar system to the entire universe. He describes the architecture of space and time, dark matter and dark energy, how galaxies form, why stars implode, how everything began, and how it's all going to end. For other enjoyable reading options from some of our Distinguished Engineers who enjoy an opportunity to read and relax, take a look at the list below. 
Matt Tice	4321- Paul Auster
Matt Tice	Leviathan - Paul Auster
Matthew Liste	Killing Commendatore - Hauruki Murakami
Matthew Liste	Super Sad True Love Story - Gary Shteyngart
Matthew Liste	Black Leopard, Red Wolf - Marlon James
Darren Marvin	Calculating the Cosmos : How Mathematics Unveils the Universe – Ian Stewart

 
Learn and Grow

blindb.jpgsapiens.jpgWhether by looking at history or examining humanity, many of our Distinguished Engineers use their reading time to learn and grow. Ta-Wei Chen has most recently been reading fascinating yet less told stories from WWII. Blind Bombing by Norman Fine reveals how classified close collaboration and technologies sharing between British and American scientists and engineers not only altered the trajectory of WWII, but fundamentally changed the nature of 20th century warfare. Along the way, a brand new applied research discipline was created - and adopted after the War by industries and business worlds. These efforts also gave birth to an indispensable device people are now taking for granted. It's called the Microwave Oven! For Ta-Wei's picks and other books for avid learners, including Matt Tice and Derek Jean-Baptiste's pick Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, check out the list below.
Ta-Wei Chen	Blackett’s War: The Men Who Defeated the Nazi U-Boats and Brought Science to the Art of Warfare  - Stephen Budiansky
Ta-Wei Chen	Blind Bombing: How Microwave Radar Brought the Allies to D-Day and Victory in World War II - Norman Fine
Matt Tice	The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy - Michael Lewis
Derek Jean-Baptiste/Matt Tice	Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind - Yuval Noah Harari 
Derek Jean-Baptiste	Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption - Bryan Stevenson 
Jey Burrows	Invisible Women, Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed For Men - Caroline Criado Perez
Todd Schmitter	Hearts for Sale!: A Buyer's Guide to Winning in Afghanistan - Fazana Marie

 
Build and Design

Mark Gibbons has even offered a free option in Shape Up, a book for teams who are struggling to shape, build and ship. Written by Basecamp, a downloadable version of the book is currently available to the inner circle of people who have heard about it through word of mouth. If you want to invest a little more into this topic, you can also check out Todd Schmitter and Allan Beck's pick, Accelerate, which examines how can we apply technology to drive business value and build a competitive advantage to our companies. This book presents both the findings and the science behind this assertion, and is ideal for management at every level.
Mark Gibbons	Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work That Matters - Ryan Singer
Allan Beck	What You Do Is Who You Are: How to Create Your Business Culture - Ben Horowitz, Kevin Kenerly
Derek Jean-Baptiste	Ahead in the Cloud: Best Practices for Navigating the Future of Enterprise IT - Stephen Orban , Andy Jassy
Derek Jean Baptiste	The 100 Day Machine Learning Book - Andriy Burkov
Todd Schmitter/Allan Beck	Accelerate: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations - Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, & Gene Kim
Tracy Pletz	Zero Trust Networks: Building Secure Systems In Untrusted Networks - Evan Gilman & Doug Barth
Tracy Pletz	Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems - Martin Kleppmann
Darren Marvin	Human Compatible: AI and the Problem of Control – Stuart Russell



2018:


DEList - Eclectic Reading for the Holidays

Compiled by Steve Turner

With Christmas not far off, the annual book review is in full swing in many publications. So this year, to give Ian Miller a rest, (I've still not got through all of his 2016 list!), we asked a few of our Distinguished Engineers for their thoughts on reads and talks that have inspired them. It's not all technical by any means, so you might just find something that will get onto your own short list.

In no particular order:

The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable (J–B Lencioni Series) (Patrick M. Lencioni) – from 2002
Recommended by David McVicar.

    "I’d recommend this, it was a book I read for the E2 module I helped at in Glasgow but I really learned a lot from reading it and would recommend it to others"

 Stories of Your Life and Others  (Ted Chiang)

Karl Kauffmann writes:

    "An intriguing compilation of short stories that leverages science fiction to expand our perceptions of the world and to reveal our inherent boundaries of understanding"

 Moonwalking withEinstein (Joshua Foer)

Ron Ritchey:

    "A well told story on the world of competitive memorization and how far an individual can push his own brain."

 

Next, three recommendations from Todd Schmitter.
The Conviction toLead: 25 Principles for Leadership that Matters (Albert Mohler)

    "The main message is that you must be passionate about something in order to be an effective leader." 

 
  Steve Jobs  (Walter Isaacson)

"Simply a fascinating biography of a unique man who had an extraordinary ability to develop a vision for something and then influence people to achieve it."

 
Ronald Reagan – Howan Ordinary Man became and Extraordinary Leader  (Dinesh D’Souza)   

"Great insight into effective leadership" 

 

 

 

 

Two recommendations from Ta-Wei Chen look very interesting.

The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History (John M. Barry)

"Thoroughly researched and extremely well written book on the deadliest pandemic (infecting 40% of the of the worldwide population) of 20th century."

     

"Study of science of life and pose profound, unanswered ethical and philosophical questions.."

 

 

 

 

Mark Jackson gives us his top 5 plus a TED Talk. "These are just good reads I've had – not books on the art/science of software engineering. All history, all fascinating, all with a science and/or civil/political focus (and all about subjects in the United States)"

What does my headscarf mean to you?

TED Talk (this generated a lot of positive discussion when I showed it in Columbus at a CIB all hands):

 

 

The Path Between The Seas  (David McCullough)

     "The building of the Panama Canal including the political skullduggery, racial injustice as well as the engineering detail."

    Ron Ritchey "+1"

The Children (David Halberstam)

    "The Nashville Student Movement and the critical role they played in accelerating the pace of the US civil rights movement."

 

 

The Fifties (David Halberstam)

    "Seminal developments in the 150s in America, including GM and the beginning of form over function and planned obsolescence; Elvis Presley and rock and roll; Truman vs Dewey; Holiday Inn and hotel chains; McDonalds and franchising; the counterculture and the beginning of the sexual revolution."

    "Finally, must reads for NY colleagues:"

The Power Broker (Robert Caro)

    "A study in power  - its creation and use (something that runs through all Caro's works – the Johnson books focus there as well).  How it impacts New York metro life to this day is fascinating – I think about it every time I travel there."

     

The Great Bridge (David McCullough)

    "An incredible look at the building of the Brooklyn Bridge.  If you don't know how it was constructed, the shenanigans behind the scenes (you're likely not aware that you're on a bridge built – and still using - defective wire), you're in for a treat.  It also pays homage to a great (and unknown) female engineer – Emily Roebling."
